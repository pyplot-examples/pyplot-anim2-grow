# PyPlot Animations
This repository contains a few simple animations in PyPlot.

## Exercises

1. In 2d-wave-animate.py, the sine wave slowly grows in amplitude and then jumps back to zero. Change it so that the sine wave slowly returns to its initial state, completing one full cycle of growing and shrinking in amplitude.

2. In 2d-wave-draw-animate.py, a portion of the sine wave is slowly drawn. Have the whole sine wave draw in exactly two seconds.

3. Add a green, dotted cos wave to the result of exercise 2.
