# PyPlot: Sine Grow Animation
This repository contains a Python script that creates a simple animation of a sine wave growing from a scale of 0 to 1.

## Exercises

1. The sine wave currently grows in scale and then jumps back to zero. Change it so that the sine wave slowly returns to its initial state, completing one full cycle of growing and shrinking in amplitude.

2. Have the animation continue, so that the wave scales slowly from 0 to -1 and back again. So the overall animation will have the wave scale from 0 to 1, then from 1 to -1, and then from -1 to 0.
